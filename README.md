## Project: PokéAPI Integration Project

Author: James Carlson

This project was built as an assignment for Coding Temple.

---

<br>My assignment was to develop a web application that integrates with [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and uses HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and asynchronous JavaScript.

To utilize the web application, enter a Pokémon name of your choice (or an ID number 1-1025), and press "I Choose You!" If the Pokémon is found, a Bootstrap card will be generated and displayed with the following information pulled from the API:
- Image
- Name
- ID number
- Type (Note: they are color-coded!)
- Stats
    - HP
    - Speed
    - Attack
    - Defense
    - Special Attack
    - Special Defense
- Up to three <b>Abilities</b> the Pokémon may learn. Click on the title to see a description.
- Up to three <b>Moves</b> the Pokémon may learn. Click on the title to see a description.
- Their signature cry will also play!

At this point, you are given the option to add the Pokémon to your team by pressing the "Add to Team" button. A Pokémon team may consist of up to six Pokémon. If you wish to make room on your team, you can utilize the "Send Back" button on a given card.

Enjoy, and thank you for reviewing my project!
